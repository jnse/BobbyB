This is a CloudBot fork, with just one plugin (besides admin commands): bobbyb

BobbyB is an implementation of the reddit /r/freefolk bobby-b bot, but for IRC.

To set this up you'll need a config.json - See the cloudbot documentation for reference: https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Configuration
